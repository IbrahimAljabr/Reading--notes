# HEROKU

Error pages are not what typically appear on your screen when you're surfing the web, but when it happens it's so annoying! To see how servers work from within, we will build a simple web server by ourselves. We will use Node.js as a server part technology for that task. Then we'll use Heroku cloud application platform to turn this local server into a world wide server.

### How can I?

We will use Node.js for our project. Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform. First of all, of course, you need to install it. You'd better check the download page for more details. I'll wait until you finish, so don't worry. Is it done? Great! Now you can create your first web server. And it will be one of the easiest tasks in your life.

### Make it worldwide

Works fine. But it works locally. WWW is for "World Wide Web" and we will turn your local server into a world wide server. We'll use Heroku cloud application platform for this. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer.
