# Guide to Grid

* display
Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

* grid-template-columns
grid-template-rows:
Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.

* grid-template-areas
Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the grid-area property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.

* grid-template
A shorthand for setting grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas in a single declaration.

* align-items
Aligns grid items along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-items which aligns along the inline (row) axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.

* align-self
Aligns a grid item inside a cell along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-self which aligns along the inline (row) axis). This value applies to the content inside a single grid item.
