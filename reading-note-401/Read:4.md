# Data Modeling

### Why should we use Test Driven Development 

- You receive fast feedback.
- You spend less time in the debugger.
- You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.

### I will use 

- beforeEach() if a method needs to be called before a test is run
- afterEach() if you need to reset the environment after a test has run

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development

The downside to TDD is that it is usually tightly associated with 'Agile' methodology, which places no importance on documentation of a system

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

- Class Inheritance: A class is like a blueprint — a description of the object to be created. Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies.
- Prototypal Inheritance: A prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly from other objects.

### Why REST?

As a company that prides itself on data quality, ease of use, performance, and reliability, we appreciate the benefits of the REST architecture.

## Term

### functional programming 
is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. 

### object-oriented programming

programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints

### Class

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

### super
The super keyword refers to the parent class

### this
The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used

### Test Driven Development 
Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed

### jest 
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications

### Continuous Integration 
In software engineering, continuous integration is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day

### Rest
Representational state transfer is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP

### Data Model
A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
