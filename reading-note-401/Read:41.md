### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
- Ducks: It outlines a strategy called 'Ducks' which lays out a way to organize a React/Redux file system at a large scale. 
The basic idea behind Ducks is to create a file structure that is scalable and easy to follow.
- Toolkit: Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. 
It also includes the most widely used Redux addons, like Redux Thunk for async logic and Reselect for writing selector functions, so that you can use them right away.

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
It allows us to write more efficient code, speed up the development process, and automatically apply the best-recommended practices. It was mainly created to solve the 
THREE MAJOR ISSUES with Redux

## Term

### redux toolkit slices
A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that 
correspond to the reducers and state. This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic.

### namespace
A namespace component is another feature request that is available in React JSX.

## Preparation Materials

### react native
React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

### expo
use expo to make any app run it everywhere.

### expo snack
Snack uses Expo under the hood. That means you can use all of the Expo APIs just like you would in a regular Expo app.

### ejecting
ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- 
one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.
