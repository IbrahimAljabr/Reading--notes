# Hash Tables

### What is a Hashtable?
- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for 
either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially 
contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

### Why do we use them?
- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library
