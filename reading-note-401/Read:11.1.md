## Read Stacks and Queues

### What is a Stack?

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### FILO
First In Last Out

### Push 
Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you 
have in the stack.

### Pop 
Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the 
Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

### Peek 
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

### Enqueue
When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many 
other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

### Dequeue 
When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other 
items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.
