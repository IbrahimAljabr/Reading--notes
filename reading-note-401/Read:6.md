### singleton 

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance

### Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

- Singleton is used by creating an ES6 class.
- public getInstance method that returns instance of the class
- Singletons can be passed as parameters

###  what approach you might use for Express uses

- get the data from req and the res 
- use the middleware 
- end the cycle 

## Term

### Router Middleware
Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

### Dynamic Module Loading

The advantage of dynamic load modules is that when you find a problem in your module, you can correct the problem and get a new version of your code running without major disruptions

### CRUD -> REST Method Matches

It is an acronym for C - create, R - read/retrieve, U -update, D - delete- the four basic functions that are implemented in any relational DB applications. 
Each of it can map to a standard SQL statement, HTTP protocol method or Data Distribution Service (DDS). One can think of REST as the “CRUD for HTTP resources & more”- 
as long as one understands the difference between http resources and db records. REST is an API architecture which interacts with complex system whereas CRUD is a set of primitive 
operations which mostly manipulates data. In this blog we will be covering the different http verbs and how they map with CRUD operations.

### Mock Testing

is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules
