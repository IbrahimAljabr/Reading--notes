# Props and State

### Does a deployed React application require a server
You don't necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. 
It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app

### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
You can test React components similar to testing other JavaScript code. 
Iteration speed vs Realistic environment: Some tools offer a very quick 
change and seeing the result, but don't model the browser behavior precisely

### What does npm run build do
runs the script "build" and created a script which runs your application - let's say server.js

### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
It describes the design principles of React itself

## Term

### BDD
In software engineering, behavior-driven development is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers

### Acceptance Tests
In engineering and its various subdisciplines, acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification 
or contract are met.

### mounting
Mounting is a process by which the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device available for users to access via the 
computer's file system.

### Build
When a user visits your site, each of your files will require an additional HTTP request, making your site slower to load. So to remedy 
this, you can create a “build” of our app, which merges all your CSS files into one file, and does the same with your JavaScript.

## Preparation Materials

### setState 
React components can, and often do, have state. State can be anything

### Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences
- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

### Forms
HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

### Components and Props
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
